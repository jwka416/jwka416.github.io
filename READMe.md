# Personal Website

Hi, my name is Wing Ki, also go by Jade.
I'm a Software Developer and a Web Developer.

This website currently only works on Desktop, I spent about 20 hours on doing this website.

There are still some problems with the wesbite such as big files loading for too long on the art page, and I haven't finished the contact page.

I will continue on updating my personal website, for more responsiveness so it can support mobile browsers as well.


This is the preview of the website:
